# Simple_Neural_Network

This code was written for COGS 18 at UCSD for a final project. It is a basic neural network that takes a matrix of mxn dimensions as an input matrix and a vector mx1 as the result. This just tries to estimate the final vector from the initial matrix, there is nothing else to it. 

For more information on any of the parts feel free to check them out. To run the code use the demo ipynb notebook created.
